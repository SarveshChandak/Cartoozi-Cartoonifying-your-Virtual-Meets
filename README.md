# Cartoozi-Cartoonifying-your-Virtual-Meets
The project is classified into two parts:  
1. Emojify: In this part face is taken as an input using the camera of your device. The image is analyzed using CNN and classified according to the dataset chosen.  
2) Cartoonify: For this part, OpenCV library is used. It is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more. In this part, an image is processed to form a cartoon like image of the face. The user can also download the image into their device.  
  
After completing the above two components of our project, we combine them using tkinter. We have create a GUI to dynamically run the above two parts in a single window on click of a single button.
